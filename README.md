# Simple Application for Mobile Phones

This repo is part of a University Semester assignment, that I built an Android Application that could locate nearby
Golf pitch and provide details on the current weather.

The app, as it is a university project, start with fixed locations presented to the user and uses google maps api
that can open Google maps after  user decides to select one of the courses.

The app has an open weather api, that is giving information of the current weather conditions of each golf course
to the user, with live data.

It is a foundation application, was tested on Android device ( Motorola Edge Neo 30).
